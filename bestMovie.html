	<h2> Why I Like the Movie </h2>
	<p>
		I like this movie because the effects are very well done and during and 
		after the movie you are constantly amazed. The movie itself is about 
		magicians pulling off amazing international tricks that help families that
		were ripped off by an insurance company. The four horseman then try and
		join The Eye. The movie itself is so mind boggling, it is a work of magic itself.

	<h2> Best Actor/Actress </h2>
	<p> 
		The best actress is Isla Fisher who plays Henley Reeves. In the movie she is 
		a self made magician that used to be one of the other character's assistant. 
		She is very funny and an independent woman in the movie. However, she does not
		appear in the sequel.
