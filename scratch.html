			<!--Name Assignment-->
			<h2> Name Assignment </h2>
			<p> Description </p>
			<p>Use the scratch website to design and create a program 
			that animates my name. The requirements were to add a 
			sprite for each letter of my name and give them 3 unique 
			behaviors. The program needed to run when the green flag 
			was clicked and for extra credit I added an action that 
			reset each time the flag was clicked. </p>
			<h3> Concepts Learned </h3>
			<ul>
				<li> Event blocks- green flag clicked, when key pressed to start animations </li>
				<li> Used conditional statements when animating sprites </li>
				<li> Used loops, forever, repeat until to make a sprite move </li>
				<li> Created my own sprite by using the editor to make adjustments to the original sprites </li>
			</ul>
